# Conformance Testing - [1.11+][6]

## Overview

With such a [wide array][2] of Kubernetes distributions available, *conformance tests* help ensure that a Kubernetes cluster meets the minimal set of features. They are a subset of end-to-end (e2e) tests that should pass on any Kubernetes cluster.

A conformance-passing cluster provides the following guarantees:

* **Best practices**: Your Kubernetes is properly configured. This is useful to know whether you are running a distribution out of the box or handling your own custom setup.

* **Predictability**: All your cluster behavior is well-documented. Available features in the official Kubernetes documentation can be taken as a given. Unexpected bugs should be rare, because distribution-specific issues are weeded out during the conformance tests.

* **Interoperability**: Workloads from other conforming clusters can be ported into your cluster, or vice versa. This standardization of Kubernetes is a key advantage of open source software, and allows you to avoid vendor lock-in.

Individual Kubernetes distributions may offer additional features beyond conformance testing, but if you change distributions, these features can't be expected to be provided.

**NOTE:** Kubernetes documentation also describes the concept of "node conformance tests". Although they are useful, these tests are more component-focused than system-wide. They validate only the behavior of a specific node, not cluster behavior as a whole.

See the [official documentation][4] for Kubernetes's existing conformance tests.

## Integration with Sonobuoy

Sonobuoy's [plugin architecture][5] enables you to integrate conformance test results into your reporting.  The e2e tests can be configured with the plugin. The default configuration runs the basic set of conformance tests against a local provider.

To customize the set of tests that are run as part of the report, the following environmental variables can be set in the [plugin-specific YAML config][7]. Typically you set this via a flow that involves the [gen command][8]:

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_FOCUS` | "Conformance" | The test suite to run.<br><br>*NOTE*: Because the real conformance suite can take up to an hour to run, the quickstart example's [e2e config][7] specifies just a single test, "Pods should be submitted and removed". |
| `E2E_SKIP` | "Alpha&#124;Disruptive&#124;Feature&#124;Flaky" | Which subset of tests to skip |
| `E2E_PROVIDER` | "local" | The platform that the cluster is running on |
| `E2E_DRYRUN` | "" | Setting any non-empty value results in skipping the actual test execution but reporting the tests as successful. This is helpful when fine tuning your focus/skip regular expressions to target the desired tests. |

*NOTE: The length of time it takes to run conformance can vary based on the size of your cluster---the timeout can be adjusted in the Server.timeoutseconds field of the Sonobuoy `config.json`.*
