## Big news!

We are now part of a brand new GitHub organization: VMware Tanzu. VMware Tanzu is a new family of projects, products and services for the cloud native world. The Sonobuoy project is a critical part to conformance tests on Kubernetes, so it makes sense that it would be moved to sit alongside all the other VMware-supported cloud native repositories. You can read more about this change in this [VMware blog post].

## Feedback

As always, we welcome feedback and participation in the development of Sonobuoy. All information on how to contact us or become involved can be found on our [community page].
