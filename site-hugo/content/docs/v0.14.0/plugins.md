## Overview

In addition to querying API objects, Sonobuoy also supports a plugin model. In this model, worker pods are dispatched into the cluster to collect data from each node, and use an aggregation URL to submit their results back to a waiting aggregation pod. See the diagram below:

Two main components specify plugin behavior:

1. **Plugin Selection**: A section in the main config (`config.json`) that declares which plugins to use in the Sonobuoy run.
  This can be generated or passed in with the `--config` flag to `sonobuoy run` or `sonobuoy gen`.

    These configs are defined by the end user.

2. **Plugin Definition**: A YAML document that defines metadata and a pod to produce a result.

    This YAML is defined by the plugin developer, and can be taken as a given by the end user.

## Plugin Definition

- `/etc/sonobuoy/plugins.d`
- `$HOME/.sonobuoy/plugins.d`
- `./plugins.d`

This search path can be overridden by the `PluginSearchPath` value of the Sonobuoy config.

### Writing your own plugin

#### The plugin definition file

``` yaml
---
sonobuoy-config:
  driver: Job        # Job or DaemonSet. Job runs once per run, Daemonset runs on every node per run.
  plugin-name: e2e   # The name of the plugin
  result-type: e2e   # The name of the "result type." Usually the name of the plugin.
spec:                # A kubernetes container spec
  env:
  - name: E2E_FOCUS
    value: Pods should be submitted and removed
  image: gcr.io/heptio-images/kube-conformance:latest
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  name: e2e
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /tmp/results
    name: results
    readOnly: false
  - mountPath: /var/log/test
    name: test-volume
extra-volumes:
- name: test-volume
  hostPath:
    # directory location on host
    path: /data
```

#### Contract

A definition file defines a container that runs the tests. This container
can be anything you want, but must fulfil a contract.

After your container completes its work, it needs to signal to Sonobuoy that
it's done. This is done by writing out a filename to a results file. The default
value is `/tmp/results/done`, which you can configure with the `ResultsDir` value 
in the Sonobuoy config.

Sonobuoy waits for the `done` file to be present, then transmits the indicated
file back to the aggregator. The results file is opaque to Sonobuoy, and is
made available in the Sonobuoy results tarball in its original form.

If you need additional mounts besides the default `results` mount that Sonobuoy
always provides, you can define them in the `extra-volumes` field.

## Available Plugins

The default Sonobuoy plugins are available in the `examples/plugins.d` directory in this repository.
Here's the current list:
